### 02 Movies Project

##### In this project, I was not using databases. Instead, I used a struct and slice to store the data of movies. MUX in golang is used for routing.I used it to route all my endpoints.

- [x] Create an API endpoint that returns all movies (GET)
- [x] Create an API endpoint that allows you to add a new movie (POST)
- [x] Create an API endpoint that allows you to delete a movie (DELETE)
- [x] Create an API endpoint that allows you to update a movie (PUT)
- [x] Create an API endpoint that returns the details of a specific movie (GET)
- [x] Use MUX for routing requests (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT)
